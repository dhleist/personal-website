      <p>Hello! My name is Dalton, and I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at Auburn University. I've gained experience coding in Java, Python, and C++ through my college coursework. In my free time, I've also worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I'm in the process of applying what I've learned both in college and on my own by creating personal projects. At the moment, I'm creating a simple web application in order to learn React and practice my back-end development skills in Java.</p>
      <p>In the future, I would love to explore more about embedded programming and low-level languages.</p>
